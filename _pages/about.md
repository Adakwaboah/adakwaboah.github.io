I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the [Computational Sensory-Motor Systems (CSMS) Lab](https://engineering.jhu.edu/csms/), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. My current research spans the spectrum of neuromorphic circuits & systems that promises "greener" Artificial Intelligence and neural interfacing electronics that hold implications for neurorehabilation as well as bidirectional communication between digital and biological (neural tissue) computers. I am advised by [Dr. Ralph Etienne-Cummings](https://engineering.jhu.edu/csms/team/rec/). Prior to joining the CSMS Lab in 2020, I worked as a research intern at the [Dr. James Weiland](https://bme.umich.edu/people/james-weiland-phd/)'s [BioElectronic Vision Lab (BEVL)](https://weilandresearch.bme.umich.edu), University of Michigan. There, I collaborated on a number of projects in areas of retinal prostheses, optimization for closed-loop neurostimulation[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3138297) and calcium imaging. 
In Summer 2022, I received the MSE in Electrical Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University <em>en route</em> the Ph.D. I also received an MS in Electronics Engineering from Norfolk State University(NSU). At NSU, I worked at the [Computational Cardiac Engineering Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/ccelabnsu/home) and was advised by [Dr. Makarand Deo](https://www.nsu.edu/engineering/Dr-Makarand-Deo). My master's thesis there focused on the formulation of heuristically optimized computational model[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.675867) of a stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte with implications in cardiac safety pharmacology. I hold a BSc. Biomedical Engineering (First Class Honors) from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana which I received in 2017. On the lighter side, I love to cook and listen to Afrobeats music.
