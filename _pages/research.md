1. Algorithmic and Hardware Co-Design of Event-based local synaptic plasticity
--------
Efforts here include the development of efficient Hebbian learning based algorithms, i.e. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and corresponding low-power neuromorphic circuits and systems in mixed analog-digital VLSI. Analog subthreshold current-mode computation offers convenient realization of addition and multiplication arithmetic. Moreso current-mode memory elements such as dynamic current mirrors can be leverage to arrive at low-power learning engines.
On the Algorithmic front, we have developed [LODeNNS](https://doi.org/10.1145/3546790.3546793), a linearly optimized Dendrocentric Nearest Neighbor STDP suitable for state-of-the-art large-scale digital neuromorphic platforms such as the Intel Loihi for spatiotemporal signal applications such as tracking and audio recognition. Future work on this include validation and application on event-based data.
On the hardware front, insights from the algorithmic level are being translated in mixed signal VLSI with implications for learning at the edge and on-the-fly, i.e. low-power intelligent sensors.
